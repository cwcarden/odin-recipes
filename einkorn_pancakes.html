    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 &#188; cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1TB lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 cups of einkorn flour</li>
        <li>1sp cinnamon</li>
        <li>1TB baking powder</li>
        <li>1 &#188; Tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3TB unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1TB maple syrup or honey</li>
        <li>1tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <ol class="ingredients">
        <li>Combine the milk and lemon juice in a small bowl. Let the mixture rest for 5 minutes. I love 
            adding lemon juice to my pancakes. I find this helps to soften the batter. If you don't have 
            lemon juice, you can skip this step and still make good pancakes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt. </li>
        <li>Add the milk to the flour mixture, along with the eggs, melted butter, maple syrup or honey, 
            and vanilla extract. Allow the batter to rest for 5-10 minutes to thicken. Whisk or stir again 
            before use. If you feel the batter is too thick (particularly when using whole wheat einkorn), 
            add more milk until you reach the desired consistency. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a griddle (or large skillet) over medium heat. <--You may need to lower the heat 
            while cooking the pancakes if your griddle gets too hot and begins to burn the pancakes, cooking 
            them too fast. Use your best judgement with this. This will vary depending on your stove-top and griddle. </li>
        <li>Add extra butter to the griddle to keep the pancake batter from sticking, then ladle the pancake batter 
            in small batches on the griddle (I use a small soup ladle to do this, or a measuring cup). 
            Cook each pancake for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. </li>
        <li>Serve warm with with butter and maple syrup (the pancakes aren't very sweet on their own). Or, serve 
            with fruit, nut butter, or topping of choice. If making the pancakes in advance, allow the pancakes to 
            fully cool before storing in a bag or container in the fridge or freezer. </li>
